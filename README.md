# Task-Service
Task Service API A lightweight REST API to manage daily tasks — built for learning, deploying, and leveling up. 
Tech Stack - Java 21 (LTS) – modern features: records, virtual threads - Spring Boot 3.x – clean, fast backend - PostgreSQL – via Docker, no cloud dependency yet - Docker – containerize everything, easy deploy - AWS (Lightsail/EC2) – live hosting target -
Future: AI integration (OpenAI API / Spring AI) for smart task suggestions 
## Goals 
1. Day 1–3: Build, Dockerize, run locally 
2. Day 4–5: Deploy to AWS, expose HTTPS 
3. Week 2: Add AI — Add task: finish report tomorrow → auto parses, sets reminder
4. Week 3: Clean repo, write docs.
